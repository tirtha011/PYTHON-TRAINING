Dinesh is fond of video games. Due to the pandemic, he
designs a video game called Corona world. In this game, the
player enters the game with a certain energy. The player
should defeat all the corona infected zombies to reach the next
level. When time increases the zombies will increase double

against all the zombies. In this case, definitely the player
